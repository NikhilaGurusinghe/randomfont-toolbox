    "Widely considered as craftspeople rather than artists, typeface\n" +
    "designers traditionally inhabited the most cloistered of\n" +
    "environments. Since the mid-eighties, however, they have had to\n" +
    "come to terms with the outside world as new technology has\n" +
    "equipped a generation of relatively unskilled type users,\n" +
    "facilitating a proliferation of new font designs. While many\n" +
    "designers and typographers are still reeling from the shock of\n" +
    "the new, Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum, a pair of young\n" +
    "designers collectively known as LettError, have set out to take\n" +
    "technology to its limits. Rather than simply adapting to change,\n" +
    "they are waiting impatiently for computers to catch up with\n" +
    "their ideas.\n\n" +

    "Beowolf, the first LettError typeface to be commercially\n" +
    "released, is still their best known. Originally called Random\n" +
    "Font, its starting point was the designers’ understanding that\n" +
    "PostScript fonts are sets of mathematical instructions, rather\n" +
    "than physical forms. When letters are stored as coded outline\n" +
    "information, they need not necessarily take the same form each\n" +
    "time they are printed: if a random element is introduced, the\n" +
    "same set of instructions can produce a variety of different\n" +
    "letterforms. Beowolf is available in different degrees of\n" +
    "randomness: Beowolf 23, for instance, is a great deal more\n" +
    "irregular and jagged than Beowolf 21. While no two instances of\n" +
    "a character ever come out the same, the letters of the Beowolf\n" +
    "typeface are instantly recognisable as part of the same family.\n\n" +

    "While Beowolf and their subsequent random fonts have broken\n" +
    "with current typographic convention, LettError view the\n" +
    "standardisation of letterforms that resulted from mechanical\n" +
    "typesetting not as typographic perfection, but merely as a phase\n" +
    "in a much longer history of written communication. Erik van\n" +
    "Blokland explains: ‘For a short while, maybe 300 years, there\n" +
    "was a system that meant letters had to be the same. A mechanical\n" +
    "system of producing type meant that there was one master form\n" +
    "and you made copies of that; it was all very logical. That is\n" +
    "why all the ‘A’s are the same and all of the ‘B’s are the same.\n" +
    "We have grown up expecting that to happen, but it is the result\n" +
    "of a mechanical process, not for any reason of understanding or\n" +
    "legibility.’\n\n" +

    "Van Blokland recalls that Beowolf found its name almost by\n" +
    "chance. Suggested by a friend, the title seemed suitable because\n" +
    "of its gothic feel, but it also referred to more than simply the\n" +
    "style of the face. The manuscript held in the British Museum of\n" +
    "the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowolf was probably made by scribes\n" +
    "in the year 1000. It is thought the poem reached its first literary\n" +
    "form late in the eighth century, but existed in any number of\n" +
    "oral forms for centuries before that. The surviving version of\n" +
    "the text, which is considered as the origin of English\n" +
    "literature, was simply one of many. Just as the poem Beowolf\n" +
    "resists traditional modes of literary criticism because it\n" +
    "cannot be treated as a unique, fixed document, so the typeface\n" +
    "escapes conventional typographic judgements. Discussions about\n" +
    "the finer points of spacing and ligature are irrelevant when\n" +
    "each letter is of uncertain form. Broader questions of\n" +
    "legibility do still apply; Beowolf remains a recognisable\n" +
    "alphabet when printed as part of a continuous text.\n\n" +

    "LettError’s experimentation with random fonts was prompted\n" +
    "by a desire to take full advantage of PostScript technology.\n" +
    "Historically, designers aiming to exploit technological\n" +
    "innovation have done so under the banner of function: when\n" +
    "typographers earlier this century proposed abandoning the\n" +
    "uppercase, they argued it would lead to more effective use of\n" +
    "contemporary typesetting machinery. LettError would not\n" +
    "claim that their typefaces are efficient in that sense — an article\n" +
    "set in Beowolf for Emigre magazine took an hour and a half to\n" +
    "print. LettError’s objective is ‘to use the technology for what\n" +
    "it is worth’. They point out that a laser printer is a very large\n" +
    "and expensive machine capable of responding to complex\n" +
    "sets of instructions, so why, when you ask for an ‘A’, should it\n" +
    "print the same form each time? You might have to wait three\n" +
    "quarters of an hour for your page of Beowolf to emerge, but at\n" +
    "least the printer is doing something instead of just sitting\n" +
    "around.";
