    "Widely considered as craftsmen rather than\n" +
    "artists, typeface designers traditionally\n" +
    "inhabited the most cloistered of environments.\n" +
    "Since the mid-eighties, however, they have had to come\n" +
    "to terms with the outside world as new technology\n" +
    "has equipped a generation of relatively unskilled\n" +
    "type users, facilitating a proliferation of new\n" +
    "font designs. While many designers and\n" +
    "typographers are still reeling from the shock of\n" +
    "the new, Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum, a\n" +
    "pair of young designers collectively known as\n" +
    "LettError, have set out to take technology to its\n" +
    "limits. Rather than simply adapting to change,\n" +
    "they are waiting impatiently for computers to\n" +
    "catch up with their ideas.\n\n" +
    "Beowolf, the first LettError typeface to be\n" +
    "commercially released, is still their best known.\n" +
    "Originally called Random Font, its starting point\n" +
    "was the designers' understanding that PostScript\n" +
    "fonts are sets of mathematical instructions,\n" +
    "rather than physical forms. When letters are\n" +
    "stored as coded outline information, they need not\n" +
    "necessarily take the same form each time they are\n" +
    "printed: if a random element is introduced, the\n" +
    "same set of instructions can produce a variety of\n" +
    "different letterforms. Beowolf is available in\n" +
    "different degrees of randomness: Beowolf 23, for\n" +
    "instance, is a great deal more irregular and\n" +
    "jagged than Beowolf 21. While no two instances of\n" +
    "a character ever come out the same, the letters of\n" +
    "the Beowolf typeface are instantly recognisable as\n" +
    "part of the same family.\n\n" +
    "While Beowolf and their subsequent random fonts\n" +
    "have broken with current typographic convention,\n" +
    "LettError view the standardisation of letterforms\n" +
    "that resulted from mechanical typesetting not as\n" +
    "typographic perfection, but merely as a phase in\n" +
    "a much longer history of written communication.\n" +
    "Erik van Blokland explains: 'For a short while,\n" +
    "maybe 300 years, there was a system that meant\n" +
    "letters had to be the same. A mechanical system of\n" +
    "producing type meant that there was one master\n" +
    "form and you made copies of that; it was all very\n" +
    "logical. That is why all the 'A's are the same and\n" +
    "all of the 'B's are the same. We have grown up\n" +
    "expecting that to happen, but it is the result of\n" +
    "a mechanical process, not for any reason of\n" +
    "understanding or legibility.'\n\n" +
    "Van Blokland recalls that Beowolf found its name\n" +
    "almost by chance. Suggested by a friend, the title\n" +
    "seemed suitable because of its gothic feel, but it\n" +
    "also referred to more than simply the style of the\n" +
    "face. The manuscript held in the British Museum\n" +
    "of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowolf was probably made\n" +
    "by scribes in the year 1000. It is thought the\n" +
    "poem reached its first literary form late in the\n" +
    "eighth century, but existed in any number of oral\n" +
    "forms for centuries before that. The surviving\n" +
    "version of the text, which is considered as the\n" +
    "origin of English literature, was simply one of\n" +
    "many. Just as the poem Beowolf resists traditional\n" +
    "modes of literary criticism because it cannot be\n" +
    "treated as a unique, fixed document, so the\n" +
    "typeface escapes conventional typographic\n" +
    "judgements. Discussions about the finer points of\n" +
    "spacing and ligature are irrelevant when each\n" +
    "letter is of uncertain form. Broader questions of\n" +
    "legibility do still apply; Beowolf remains a\n" +
    "recognisable alphabet when printed as part of a\n" +
    "continuous text.\n\n" +
    "LettError's experimentation with random fonts was\n" +
    "prompted by a desire to take full advantage of\n" +
    "PostScript technology. Historically, designers\n" +
    "aiming to exploit technological innovation have\n" +
    "done so under the banner of function: when\n" +
    "typographers earlier this century proposed\n" +
    "abandoning the uppercase, they argued it would\n" +
    "lead to more effective use of contemporary\n" +
    "typesetting machinery. LettError would not claim\n" +
    "that their typefaces are efficient in that sense -\n" +
    "an article set in Beowolf for Emigre magazine took\n" +
    "an hour and a half to print. LettError's objective\n" +
    "is 'to use the technology for what it is worth'.\n" +
    "They point out that a laser printer is a very\n" +
    "large and expensive machine capable of responding\n" +
    "to complex sets of instructions, so why, when you\n" +
    "ask for an 'A', should it print the same form each\n" +
    "time? You might have to wait three quarters of an\n" +
    "hour for your page of Beowolf to emerge, but at\n" +
    "least the printer is doing something instead of\n" +
    "just sitting around.";
